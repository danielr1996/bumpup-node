# idempotent-release
The best of
[standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#readme),
[release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#readme) and
[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

Key Concepts:
- idempotent: running the command multiple times yields the same result
- configurable and language-agnostic: works with any language and workflow
- does only on thing, no integrated commiting or publishing
